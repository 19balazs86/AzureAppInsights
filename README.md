# Playing with Azure Application Insights
Just a click to set up Application Insights for a web application through the Azure Portal.

Manually set it up gives the opportunity to leverage the whole possibilities of the framework. Filtering which collector modules want to use, add custom properties that can be useful and so on.

In this repository, I set it up by manually for a Web API with some examples and customizations.
