# Playing with Azure Application Insights
Setting up Application Insights for a web application through the Azure Portal is just a click away.

Manually setting it up gives you the chance to take full advantage of the framework, allowing you to choose which collector modules to use, add custom properties that may be useful, and so on.

In this repository, I have manually set up Application Insights for a `WorkerService` and a `Web API` with several examples and customizations.
